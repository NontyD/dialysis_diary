![calendar.js](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzibrzlq9/image/upload/v1741719302/jshint_cragmi.png)

## Python Validation Tests

- **Python Validation**: Used [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) to validate Python code. My website comprises of 7 apps with an average of 4 python files each. I have tested all of them but attaching all the screenshots will overcrowd this document. I have cleaned them up according to the pep8 report. There are few others that shortning the character length would beat pep8 purpose of readability as they were only one character over the limit and sometimes it would just be a closing bracket.

## Lighthouse Scores

- **Lighthouse Scores**: Used [Lighthouse Metrics](https://lighthouse-metrics.com/) to measure the scores

## Browser Compatibility

The website was manually tested in chrome, firefox and edge and it worked accross those different browsers

## Accessibility

- **Accessibility**: Used [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/). I could only manage to test the pages that are accessible without login, for the other pages, I used the report I got from home page to clean them up.

## Responsiveness

- **Responsiveness**: Used [Am I responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive). I had to download Ignore X-frames extesion to be able to use the test. However, I could only manage to test the home page and login page as there was a security warning when I logged in.
