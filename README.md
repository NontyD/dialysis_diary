## User Experience

### Patient-Centered Approach

The design of Dialysis Connect is based on firsthand experience as a dialysis patient, focusing on features that are most relevant and beneficial. Informal feedback was gathered from fellow patients during hospital visits, providing valuable insights into usability and functionality.

### Color Scheme & Imagery

The Dialysis Connect website employs a minimalist and calming color palette to ensure a non-distracting and informative experience. The overall design approach ensures that Dialysis Connect remains an informative and functional platform, where content is the focal point, and aesthetics serve to support usability rather than overshadow it.

### Agile Planning

This project was developed using agile methodologies. An MVP (Minimum Viable Product) milestone was established to focus on delivering essential features. Each user story is accompanied by a comprehensive set of acceptance criteria, ensuring that all functionalities are well defined and meet completion standards.

### Database design

The Dialysis Connect database is designed to support a community-driven platform for dialysis patients. It facilitates event management, user-generated posts and comments, document uploads, and dialysis records tracking. This database follows a relational structure to ensure data consistency, integrity, and efficient querying.

The database comprises of 6 tables:

- Users Table (users) - This table stores user information and serves as the primary reference for other tables.
- Events Table (events) - This table stores event details, allowing users to track appointments and reminders.
- Posts Table (posts) - This table manages user-generated posts within the community section.
- Comments Table (comments) - This table stores comments on posts, facilitating discussions.
- Dialysis Records Table (dialysis_records) - This table stores user-submitted dialysis records to help track health data over time.
- Uploaded Files Table (uploaded_files) - This table allows users to upload and manage medical documents and images.

#### Relationships

- **Users & Events:** One-to-many (a user can have multiple events).

- **Users & Posts:** One-to-many (a user can create multiple posts).

- **Users & Comments:** One-to-many (a user can comment on multiple posts).

- **Users & Dialysis Records:** One-to-many (each user maintains multiple dialysis records).

- **Users & Uploaded Files:** One-to-many (users can upload multiple files).

- **Posts & Comments:** One-to-many (each post can have multiple comments).

#### Design considerations

- **Data Integrity:** Foreign key constraints ensure data consistency.

- **Scalability:** Optimized indexing and proper normalization support future growth.

- **Security:** User authentication should be handled securely to restrict data access.

- **Performance:** Time-based indexing on created_at fields optimizes querying.

### Tools used

- Git: Used commands such as `git` `add` - `commit -m "message'` - `push`.
- Gitpod: Initially used as IDE but later migrated to VS code
- VS code: Used as my IDE.
- Github: Used as the code hosting.
- [Favicon io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/): Used to generate the faveicon.
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/desktop/): Used to create the wireframes - desktop version.
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/): Used to host all my images.
- [dbdiagraim.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home): Used to create the ERD.
- [cloudconvert](https://cloudconvert.com/mp4-to-gif): Used to convert video to gif

## Migration from Gitpod to VS code

I initially started my project using Gitpod but later needed to migrate to VS Code. During the migration process, I encountered several challenges that made it difficult to seamlessly transfer the project. As a result, I ultimately decided to set up a fresh environment in VS Code and manually copy my existing code from Gitpod to ensure a smooth transition.

## Fixed bugs

The bugs were carefully managed and fixed as they arose, with particular attention given to maintaining readability and functionality within the character constraints. Each issue was addressed through an iterative debugging process, incorporating thorough testing and validation to prevent regressions. Error handling and input validation were refined to enhance user experience and prevent unexpected behavior. Additionally, debugging efforts focused on optimizing performance, improving maintainability, and ensuring compliance with best practices. This structured approach resulted in a clean, functional, and efficient final product.

## Known Issues

The following bugs are yet to be resolved and will be addressed in future improvements:

- **Event Deletion in Calendar** – When an event is deleted, it does not immediately disappear from the calendar view. A manual page refresh is required for the changes to reflect.
- **Calendar Clickability on Mobile** – On mobile screens, the calendar is not responsive to clicks, preventing users from interacting with events as expected.

## Unimplemented Features

The following features were planned and partially coded but are not yet functional. They will be implemented in future updates:

- **User Settings (Profile Editing & Deletion)** – The backend logic for user profile editing and deletion exists, but the feature has not been integrated into the UI or made accessible to users.
- **Filtering in Records** – A filtering function was planned to allow users to view records from a specific week or month. Currently, records are displayed in chronological order, and users can scroll to find past entries. The future implementation will introduce a date-based filter to improve accessibility and navigation.

## Testing

For a detailed overview of both manual and automated testing processes, please refer to [TESTING.md](https://github.com/NontyD/dialysis_diary/blob/main/TESTING.md). It covers all testing scenarios and methodologies used in the project.
